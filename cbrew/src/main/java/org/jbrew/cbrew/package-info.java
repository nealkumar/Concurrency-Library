/**
 * This library contains native facade implementations of the JBrew utility

 * features specific optimizations for Unix-based systems in terms of
 * performance and memory. This is achieved through careful tuning using the C
 * programing language to not only control for gargbage collection, but also to
 * ensure maximum performance for elected library features. <code>CBrew</code>
