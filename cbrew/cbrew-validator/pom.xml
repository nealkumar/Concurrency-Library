	<description>
		This library contains native facade implementations of the JBrew utility libraries with the Java Native Interface
		(JNI). This set of libraries features specific optimizations for Unix-based systems in terms of performance 
		and memory. This is achieved through careful tuning using the C programming language to not only control for 
		garbage collection, but also to ensure maximum performance for elected library features. This library in particular
		features example usages of the JNI in order to test hardware for usability.
